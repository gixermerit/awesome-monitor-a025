# Bioinformatics in Rust

Welcome to **seq.rs**! This is your go-to hub for all things Rust in the world
of bioinformatics.
This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and styled using the sleek
and minimal [PaperMod](https://github.com/cydave/zola-theme-papermod) theme to deliver
a fast, accessible, and user-friendly experience.

## What is seq.rs?

The goal of this project is to serve as a newsletter,
showcasing the exciting intersection of **systems programming** and **biological data**
through the lens of the Rust programming language.
Whether you're a researcher, developer, student, or just bio-curious, this site
aims to highlight how the Rust ecosystem is evolving to meet the complex demands
of modern bioinformatics.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Each Month

- **Spotlights** on both popular and emerging Rust-based bioinformatics tools and crates
- **Research paper summaries** relevant to bioinformatics and computational biology
- **Challenges** to sharpen your Rust and algorithmic skills

A new issue is released during the first week of every month;
typically on the first day of them month.
